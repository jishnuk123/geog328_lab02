    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>Here are some of the main projects I’ve been developing to strengthen my technical and creative skills:</p>

    <!-- Accordion Section -->
    <button class="accordion">Project 1: Personal Website (React)</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        I designed and developed my own personal portfolio website using <strong>React.js</strong> 
        to showcase my resume, projects, and technical skills. The goal of this project was to 
        create a clean, responsive, and interactive way for others to learn more about me as a 
        developer and data enthusiast. The website includes a dynamic project gallery, smooth 
        navigation, and an about section that highlights my interests in AI and data engineering.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Project 2: Fantasy Football Optimizer (Machine Learning)</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        This ongoing project involves building a <strong>machine learning model</strong> that 
        analyzes player performance statistics to optimize fantasy football lineups. I have been 
        experimenting with regression models and predictive analytics to find patterns in player stats 
        and matchups. The project combines my interest in sports and data science 
        helping me apply real-world machine learning concepts in a fun and 
        competitive context but it is still a work in progress.
      </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Project 3: Spotify Music Recommender System</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Another project I have been planning  is a <strong>Spotify music recommender</strong> that 
        uses machine learning to suggest songs based on a user listening history and mood. 
        I want the system to utilizes track features such as genre, preference, and likings while 
        using Spotify’s API to train a recommendation model. This project has not been
        started yet but I think it will help explore recommendation algorithms, 
        user-based vs. item-based filtering, and the integration 
        of AI models with real-world APIs.
