  <h3> Travel Goals</h3>
  <p>
    One of my biggest goals is to travel the world and experience different cultures because I have never been out of the US and India. 
    I’ve always been fascinated by history, architecture, and natural landscapes, which is why my top three dream destinations are 
    <strong>Egypt</strong>, <strong>Australia</strong>, and <strong>Japan</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to visit <strong>Egypt</strong> to see the Great Pyramids mainly and  <strong>Australia</strong> is on my list for Sydney mainly and
    finally, <strong>Japan</strong> fascinates me with its mix of futuristic technology and deep-rooted traditions — I’d love to experience cherry blossom season in person.
    And finally if I do have the chance I would love to visit Korea, specifically Busan because I have friends that live there.

<!-- Career Goals -->
  <h3>Career Goals</h3>
  <p>
    Professionally, my main goal is to become an <strong>AI/ML-focused Data Scientist or Data Engineer</strong>. 
    I’m passionate about using data to build smarter systems that can automate processes, optimize decision-making, 
    and uncover meaningful insights especially in a time where artificial intelligence is very prominent.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to pursuing a data-driven career, I’m also working on learning more about <strong>investing in stocks and financial data analytics</strong>. 
    Understanding how markets behave through data visualization and machine learning models is something that deeply interests me. 
    Over time, I hope to use my technical skills to explore innovative intersections between <strong>AI, finance, and geography</strong> — 
    and find ways to involve myself in these areas. Though it is hopeful I hope I can achieve these goals by working hard
    and learning everyday.
