       <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi! I’m <strong>Jishnu Kandala</strong>, a senior studying <strong>Geography</strong> with a focus on the <strong>Data Science track</strong>. 
            I’ve always been fascinated by how data and location come together to tell meaningful stories about the world around us.

            This website is a reflection of my academic journey and the interests that inspire me to keep learning — from exploring urban geography and data visualization to applying machine learning in creative ways. 
            I’m passionate about bridging the gap between spatial thinking and modern data tools to make informed, impactful decisions.
