        <h1>My Interests</h1>

    <p>
        I’ve been playing volleyball for quite a while now, and it’s one of my favorite ways to stay active and connect with friends. 
        I really enjoy the fast pace of indoor volleyball and the thrill of spiking or blocking a shot at the net. 
        Playing regularly has helped me build leg strength, improve my reaction time, and stay disciplined with physical activity — plus, joining intramurals here at UW has made it even more fun.
    </p>

    <p>
        Alongside volleyball, I’ve developed a consistent routine of <strong>working out at the gym</strong>. 
        It’s become a great way to stay healthy, productive, and grounded throughout the week. 
        Whether it’s lifting, cardio, or just stretching after a long study session, going to the gym helps me relax and clear my mind on stressful days while keeping me focused and energized.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another big part of my day-to-day life is <strong>listening to music on Spotify</strong>. 
        I love discovering new music and exploring different genres, from rap and hip-hop to lo-fi and even classical music when I’m studying. 
        Music has a way of setting the right mood for whatever I’m working on, and it’s something I always keep on in the background whether I’m coding, cooking, or just winding down.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recently, I’ve also been learning how to <strong>cook</strong>. 
        It’s been a fun but sometimes challenging hobby and definitely takes practice but there is still 
        something really rewarding about making my own meal from scratch and seeing it turn out well. 
        IT has defintely taught me patience, creativity, and how to enjoy the process (even when things don’t go perfectly).
    </p>

    <p>
        Altogether, these hobbies keep me balanced and blend activity, creativity, and relaxation into my routine. 
        They’ve helped me stay focused on both my studies and personal growth. I have my social media and LinkedIn on my Page
        and am always looking for people who share the same interests as me!
